## Overview

This repository contains a Python script for collecting data from the Google Maps API using the DataForSEO platform. The script submits tasks to the DataForSEO API, processes the responses, and saves the output as a raw JSON file. This repository is designed for educational purposes, specifically for students learning about data science and API integration.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **API Key**: Obtain an API key from DataForSEO. Sign up at [DataForSEO](https://dataforseo.com/) to get your API key.
3. **Libraries**: Install the required Python libraries.

## Installation

0. **Project Setup Instructions**

    Step 0: Install Python 3.12.3

    Make sure you have Python 3.12.3 installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3123/).

    To check your Python version, open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jlph79/CTRT_DataForSeo_GoogleMaps
    cd dataforseo-google-maps
    ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**

    Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Note: In this case, all required libraries are available in the Python scripts. This step is only for demonstrating a best practice for installing required packages.
    
## Usage

Every DataForSEO user has an 'account' and a unique password generated by DataForSEO. This is not the same password as the one you use to log into the DataForSEO portal. You can find the account and API password in the DataForSEO dashboard. For the documentation of the API endpoints, you can visit [DataForSEO API Documentation](https://docs.dataforseo.com/v3/serp/google/overview/?bash&_gl=1*eo9o81*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTUwMjUyMjQ5NC4xNzE4MzY1Njk1*_ga_T5NKP5Y695*MTcxODM2NTY5NC4xLjEuMTcxODM2NjkwMC4wLjAuMTE1OTcwMDQwNA..).

1. **Configure API Key**

    Open the `GoogleMapsEndPoint_raw.py` file and replace `'api credentials'` with your actual DataForSEO API key.

    ```python
        RestClient = RestClient("your_account@example.com", "xxxxxxxxxxx") 
    ```

2. **Run the Script**

    Execute the script to start collecting data:

    ```bash
    python GoogleMapsEndPoint_raw.py
    ```

3. **Output**

    The script will generate a raw JSON file containing the collected data.

## Script Flow

The following flowchart illustrates the script flow:

1. **Initialize RestClient**
2. **Create RestClient Object**
3. **Submit Google Maps Task**
4. **Post Task to DataForSEO API**
5. **Task Submission Response**
   - **Success**: Extract Task IDs and wait for task completion
   - **Failure**: Log error and exit
6. **Check Task Status**
   - **Completed**: Save data to JSON file
   - **In Queue or Processing**: Wait and retry
   - **Error**: Log error and exit

For a detailed understanding, refer to the `GoogleMapsEndPoint_raw.py` script and the accompanying flowchart.
